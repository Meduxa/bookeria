# Changelog

All notable changes per phase. Newest on top.

## Before the pilot — part 1 (2026-10-28)

- **Sign out of all devices**: in the account menu (after a confirmation) — for a lost phone or a shared computer. Other devices are signed out on their next click; recorded in the audit log.
- **Waitlist SMS offer**: after a cancellation, the clients waiting for that time show up with an "Offer by SMS" button that sends them the freed date and time with the business phone. Pressing twice does not send twice.
- **Bookeria support access (view only)**: the owner can let Bookeria support look at the business for 24 hours or 3 days (Settings → Business) and end it at any time. Support sees the screens like an admin, with a banner, but the database refuses every change; treatment notes stay hidden. Allowing, ending and every visit are in the business's audit log.
- **Each business gets its own small website** (the booking page): cover photo, logo, a few words about the business in ka/en/ru, Instagram and Facebook, photos, team, hours and map, with a big "Book a visit" button. The owner fills it in under Settings → "Your website" and picks one of 5 colour themes. Clients can start "by service" or "by specialist". Shared links show the cover and description. The demo salon and clinic have a cover, logo and text.
- The booking button "Cancel" is now "Cancel booking" — the confirmation showed two buttons both called "Cancel" (ka/en).

## Phase 6b — Ready for production (2026-10-26)

- **Installable app**: Bookeria can be added to a phone's home screen with its own icon; an "Install the app" button (Android/Chrome) or a hint (iPhone) in the menu; a friendly page when there is no internet. Nothing personal is stored on the phone.
- **Security**: browser security headers on every page (no embedding in other sites, scripts only from us and the database), 0 known vulnerable packages, written review with a before-go-live list. Fixed: names starting with "=" could run as formulas when an export was opened in Excel.
- **Accessibility**: automatic WCAG 2.1 AA checks on 16 screens at phone and desktop size; fixed keyboard access to scrolling strips and the contrast of inactive tabs and finished bookings.
- **Speed**: every main page loads in under a second on the production build (`docs/performance.md`).
- **Legal pages**: privacy policy, terms of service and data processing agreement in ka/en/ru, clearly marked as drafts for the lawyer; linked from sign-up and the booking page.
- **Error reports (Sentry)** and **email (Resend)** ready, switched on by entering their keys; error reports never contain client data.
- **Going live**: Netlify configuration, the SMS and daily jobs as scheduled functions, automatic checks on GitHub, an encrypted nightly backup while on Supabase's free plan, and a step-by-step guide (`docs/go-live.md`). Demo data and database tests can no longer touch any project but the dev one. Without an SMS company, SMS are logged as "not sent" instead of failing.

## Phase 6a — Reports, account and platform admin (2026-10-26)

- **Dashboard home** for owners/admins: today's bookings and money received, this month's revenue, occupancy, new clients and no-shows, birthdays in the next 7 days, SMS left (with a warning when low), and a first-steps checklist that ticks itself and disappears when done.
- **Reports** (period presets or dates, one specialist or all): money received by day and payment method, service value by category, per specialist (service value, commission, booked vs working hours, occupancy), top services, booking sources and statuses, no-show and cancellation rates, new vs returning clients, retention after 30/60/90 days. **Excel download** with the same filters. Admins see no money when the owner switched revenue off.
- **Owner's data and account** (Settings → Business): download everything (Excel or JSON), audit log page with readable actions and filters, delete the business — typed name, 14 days to change your mind, banner on every page meanwhile.
- **Plans and status**: placeholder plans (Trial, Start, Pro, Clinic) with a staff limit; trial ends → "payment due" banner (online booking keeps working); suspended → read-only (viewing and export still work). Decision 009.
- **Platform admin area** `/admin` (Levan only; others get "not found"): all businesses with owner, plan, status, staff, bookings, SMS left and last activity; change plan/status/trial; add SMS credits; edit plans; SMS log across businesses with error rate. Make yourself admin with `npm.cmd run platform-admin -- your@email`.
- **Photo gallery** (up to 12) shown on the booking page.
- **Daily job** (`/api/cron/daily`, also run by `npm.cmd run jobs`): ends trials, deletes businesses whose 14 days are over, adds monthly included SMS.
- 8 new security tests (platform admin, plans, staff limit, deletion, export, photos); report calculations unit-tested.
- **Tests**: end-to-end tests now run against a production build (decision 010): 1.5 minutes instead of 4, and stable. The dashboard numbers are reused for one minute per business, so many sign-ins at once stay fast.

## Phase 5 — SMS (2026-10-26)

- **One SMS queue and log** for everything: booking codes, confirmations, reminders, moved/cancelled messages, manual SMS and promotions. A message can never go twice; failed sends are retried and their credits returned. The owner/admin sees every message with its status in **Settings → SMS → Message log** (codes are blanked out).
- **Credits** in SMS parts: every business starts with 50 trial SMS; a warning appears on the dashboard and in SMS settings when few are left. One Georgian SMS holds 70 characters, so a message with a manage link usually takes 2.
- **Reminders**: 2 hours before by default, 24 hours optional; never inside quiet hours (default 22:00–09:00 — sent when they end, if still before the visit); a moved booking gets a fresh reminder.
- **Booking messages**: confirmation when the team books (not for walk-ins) or a client books online, "moved", "cancelled by the business", and "confirmed" when a pending online booking is approved — each can be switched off.
- **Texts**: every message type in Georgian, English and Russian, editable with variables ({client_name}, {date}, {time}, {manage_link}…), live preview and a character/SMS counter; unknown variables are refused.
- **Sender name** (e.g. SalonNino) with status; a new name waits for the SMS company's approval.
- **Manual SMS** from the client card; **promotions** to all clients who agreed (optionally by tag), with an unsubscribe link and page. Clients without consent never get promotions — they are logged as skipped.
- **Test SMS** button. Background job `npm.cmd run jobs` (production: the host calls it every minute with `CRON_SECRET`).
- **Not yet**: a real SMS company (Levan chooses later, decision 008) — until then messages are only printed in the dev server window.
- Fixed: translations in background jobs used no language; "send now" used the computer's clock instead of the database's.

## Phase 4 — Public online booking page (2026-10-26)

- **Booking page** `/book/<business>` (e.g. /book/demo-salon), built for phones, in Georgian with a language switch: business card (call, directions, opening hours, team) → services → a person or "anyone available" → day and free time → name, phone, optional email and comment → SMS code → booked. Only real free times are offered, with the business's online rules (notice, how far ahead, services and people bookable online, blocked clients).
- **SMS code** before booking, on by default (owner switch in Settings). Codes last 5 minutes, 5 tries, at most 3 per phone per hour. Until Phase 5 the SMS goes to a fake provider: the code is printed in the dev server window.
- **Confirmation**: "add to calendar" (.ics) and an SMS with a private **manage link** `/m/<key>`, where the client can move or cancel until the cancellation window; after that the page shows the business phone. Online bookings start as confirmed, or pending if the business approves them.
- **Consent**: marketing boxes are unticked by default; a ticked box is recorded with the source "booking page". Returning clients are recognised by phone.
- **Settings**: booking link with copy/open and a QR code to print; SMS-code switch. The team sees "online" and the client's comment on the booking.
- **Security** (decision 007): visitors' browsers get no new database access; everything goes through server code. Codes and manage keys are stored only scrambled. Rate limits and a hidden trap field against bots. 9 new security tests.
- Dashboard checklist now links to services, staff, hours and the booking link.

## After Phase 3b (2026-10-26)

- **Logo** in the sidebar, phone header, sign-in pages and browser tab; works in dark mode.
- **Faster panels, no stuck buttons**: client card, booking history and payments now load in parallel (decision 006). Before, a button pressed right after opening a panel ("arrived", "view notes") could wait 15+ seconds on a busy server.
- **Dates** everywhere use our own month names, so server and browser always show the same text (fixed a page redraw on the clients list).
- Client list order is stable for clients added at the same moment (imports).

## Phase 3b — Calendar and bookings, the rest (2026-10-26)

- **Recurring bookings**: "repeat every N weeks, X times" in the new-booking panel; the list of dates shows clashes before saving, clashing dates can be skipped, the series is saved in one go. "Cancel this and all following" on any booking of a series.
- **Waitlist**: when nothing is free, add the client with wished dates, times and person. The list sits in the calendar; when a booking is cancelled the matching waitlist entries are suggested and can be booked in one click.
- **Checkout**: extra items, discount (amount or %), split payment (cash, card, transfer, gift card), tip per person; paid / partly paid shown on bookings. **Cash page**: daily totals by method and by person, payments list, unpaid visits of the last 30 days. Owner switch decides whether administrators see revenue; staff see only their own.
- **Dental chair view**: day view by chair/room as well as by doctor.
- **Booking import**: paste from Excel or upload .xlsx/.csv; columns are recognised in Georgian, English and Russian and can be corrected; every row is previewed with its problems (unknown service, unknown person, bad date/time/phone/price); good rows import, rows that overlap an existing booking are reported back by line. Clients are matched by phone or created. No SMS is ever sent for imported bookings. Managers only.
- **Security**: 5 new tables with forced RLS, 8 new isolation tests (161 in total).
- **Speed**: a day with 15 staff and 150 bookings loads in about 340 ms from Georgia (test included).
- Tests: end-to-end tests no longer depend on run order or on fresh demo data; local runs use 3 browsers at a time.

## Phase 3a — Calendar and bookings, core (2026-10-27)

- **Bookings in the database**: bookings, one line per service with price and duration copied at booking time, status history, dental treatment notes. All changes go through checked database functions; a staff member may create and move only their own bookings. Double booking is impossible: the database refuses overlapping times for a person or a chair, including two clicks at the same moment (tested).
- **Availability engine**: free times from opening hours, staff hours, date changes, time off, existing bookings with their breaks, chairs, booking rules and the business time zone; "anyone free" picks the least busy person. 17 tests.
- **Calendar**: day (staff as columns), week (one person), list (phone default) and month views; shaded non-working time, hatched time off, red current-time line; Georgian dates ("26 ოქტომბერი, ორშაბათი") from our own month names.
- **Booking**: click an empty slot → find or add the client (allergy warning, no-show count) → services → person or anyone free → real free times → book. Managers can book outside hours after a warning.
- **Changing bookings**: drag to move (time, person, day), drag the bottom edge to change length; reschedule form on phones; status buttons (confirm, arrived, start, complete, no-show, cancel with reason, undo); notes; history. Changes by other admins appear live.
- **My day** for masters and doctors; **visit history** on the client card; **treatment notes** for dental clinics (doctors and owner only, every read logged).
- Demo data now includes bookings from 3 days ago to 6 days ahead.
- Fixed during the phase: deleting a business with bookings could have failed (foreign-key rule), a moved booking jumped back until the refresh, time zone hard-coded in two places, Georgian no-show wording.

## Phase 1 — Services, staff, clients + design foundation (2026-10-26)

- **Design**: light and dark theme from Levan's references (green main colour, grouped sidebar, status pills, number cards, details panel sliding in from the right, filter tabs with counts); colour contrast checked; Inter + Noto Sans Georgian; "More" page on phones.
- **Services**: categories (reorder), fixed / "from" / range prices, duration, break after, online/hidden, colour, variants and add-ons; chairs/rooms requirement for dental.
- **Price list import**: paste from a website or Excel, or upload .xlsx/.csv. Recognises category rows and prices like 35, 25-დან, 250–300, 150–200-დან; asks for a duration where the list has none. Tested with two real price lists (20 services in one go).
- **Staff**: profile with photo and calendar colour, link to a login, services with own price/time, weekly schedule with lunch breaks, one-off date changes, time off (in Tbilisi time).
- **Business settings**: contact details, opening hours, closed days, booking rules (notice, how far ahead, cancellation window, time step, approval), what staff can see, chairs/rooms.
- **Clients / patients**: search by name/phone/email, card with important-note warning, tags, preferred staff, block online booking; marketing consent per channel with dated history; merge duplicates; owner can download a client's data or delete personal data; client import with column recognition in ka/en/ru and duplicate checks.
- **Security**: 16 new tables, all with forced RLS and links that cannot cross businesses; 136 isolation tests in total. Atomic database functions for schedules, staff services, opening hours, imports, merge, export, anonymise.
- **Demo data**: both demo businesses now have services (incl. the spec's examples), staff with schedules, 30 clients each, chairs for the clinic.
- Fixed during the phase: a client-import bug that could attach consent to the wrong client; prices showed "GEL 55" in browsers without Georgian locale data; a browser component importing server-only code.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (2026-10-25)

- Next.js 16 (App Router, strict TypeScript), Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, lucide icons; `APP_NAME` in `src/lib/app.ts`.
- Georgian / English / Russian with next-intl. The app always opens in Georgian; a language switcher is on every page. A test keeps the three translation files in sync.
- Supabase dev project `bookeria-dev` in Frankfurt. First migration: businesses (tenants), profiles, memberships (owner / admin / staff), invitations, audit log. Row Level Security on and forced on every table; writes that span tables go through checked database functions.
- 32 tenant-isolation tests prove a user of business A cannot see or change anything of business B, staff cannot do owner/admin actions, anonymous visitors see nothing, and a business can be deleted cleanly.
- Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out; create a business (salon or dental clinic) with an auto-generated booking address (Georgian names are transliterated); invite staff by link (email goes through the email adapter — fake provider for now); accept invitation; switch between businesses.
- Dashboard shell: sidebar on desktop, bottom navigation on phones, "Patients" instead of "Clients" for dental clinics, placeholder pages for Calendar / Clients / Services, onboarding checklist.
- Helpers with tests: phone numbers to E.164 (+995), money as integer tetri, slugs.
- Demo data: "სალონი ნინო" and "დენტალ სმაილი" with owner, administrator and staff each.
- Fixed during the phase: business deletion was blocked by the membership audit trigger; emails typed with spaces were rejected; avatar initials turned Georgian letters into Mtavruli capitals; invite email no longer travels in the URL; auth pages now have a real page heading.
- Decisions: 001 Cache Components off, 002 cloud dev database instead of Docker, 003 own invitations table.

## [Unreleased]
- Project brief, rules, specification, roadmap and Claude Code skills created.
