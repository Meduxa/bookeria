# Changelog

All notable changes per phase. Newest on top.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (2026-10-25)

- Next.js 16 (App Router, strict TypeScript), Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, lucide icons; `APP_NAME` in `src/lib/app.ts`.
- Georgian / English / Russian with next-intl. The app always opens in Georgian; a language switcher is on every page. A test keeps the three translation files in sync.
- Supabase dev project `bookeria-dev` in Frankfurt. First migration: businesses (tenants), profiles, memberships (owner / admin / staff), invitations, audit log. Row Level Security on and forced on every table; writes that span tables go through checked database functions.
- 32 tenant-isolation tests prove a user of business A cannot see or change anything of business B, staff cannot do owner/admin actions, anonymous visitors see nothing, and a business can be deleted cleanly.
- Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out; create a business (salon or dental clinic) with an auto-generated booking address (Georgian names are transliterated); invite staff by link (email goes through the email adapter — fake provider for now); accept invitation; switch between businesses.
- Dashboard shell: sidebar on desktop, bottom navigation on phones, "Patients" instead of "Clients" for dental clinics, placeholder pages for Calendar / Clients / Services, onboarding checklist.
- Helpers with tests: phone numbers to E.164 (+995), money as integer tetri, slugs.
- Demo data: "სალონი ნინო" and "დენტალ სმაილი" with owner, administrator and staff each.
- Fixed during the phase: business deletion was blocked by the membership audit trigger; emails typed with spaces were rejected; avatar initials turned Georgian letters into Mtavruli capitals; invite email no longer travels in the URL; auth pages now have a real page heading.
- Decisions: 001 Cache Components off, 002 cloud dev database instead of Docker, 003 own invitations table.
