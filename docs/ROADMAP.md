# Bookeria — Build Roadmap

Work one phase at a time. Claude Code ticks the boxes and updates `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of each phase. Rough durations assume a few focused hours per day.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (≈ 2–4 days)
✅ Done 2026-10-25

- [x] Tools checked (Node 24 LTS, Git), Git repo initialised — no Docker (no admin rights on the laptop), see decision 002
- [x] Next.js 16 + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui
- [x] Supabase EU cloud **dev** project `bookeria-dev` (Frankfurt) instead of local Docker; env files; typed Supabase clients (server, browser, admin)
- [x] next-intl (ka default — always, not from browser language — en, ru), temporary Noto Sans Georgian font (final font in Phase 2)
- [x] ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, RLS test setup (Vitest integration tests against the dev project)
- [x] Migration: tenants, profiles, memberships, invitations, audit_log + RLS + isolation tests (32)
- [x] Sign-up → create business (salon/dental) → invite staff (link) → accept → dashboard shell (sidebar desktop, bottom nav mobile)
- [x] Seed: demo salon + demo dental clinic (`npm.cmd run db:seed`)
- [x] `APP_NAME` constant
- [ ] Production Supabase project (separate from dev) — create before the pilot
- [ ] Transactional email provider (invites + sign-up confirmation) — needed before the pilot

## Phase 1 — Services, staff, clients (≈ 1 week) — SPEC 4.1–4.4
✅ Done 2026-10-26 (built after the design foundation, see Phase 2 and decision 004)

- [x] Business settings (details, opening hours, holidays/closed days, booking rules, staff visibility)
- [x] Locations (data model; one primary location in UI, created with the business)
- [x] Service categories (reorder with buttons), services (fixed / from / range price), variants, add-ons, per-staff price/duration
- [x] Price list import (paste or CSV/XLSX) with preview and error report — tested with two real Georgian price lists
- [x] Staff profiles (photo, login link), weekly schedules (split shifts), date changes, time off, services per staff
- [x] Resources (chairs/rooms) for dental
- [x] Clients: card, server-side search, tags, important note, marketing consents with history, preferred staff, block online booking
- [x] Client import (paste or CSV/XLSX), duplicate detection (file + existing), merge
- [x] Client export (JSON) / anonymise (owner only, audited)
- [ ] Visit history on the client card — needs bookings (Phase 3)
- [ ] Staff levels — skipped by decision (per-staff price covers it)

## Phase 2 — Design system (≈ 3–5 days)
Design foundation done 2026-10-26 from screenshots + videos (no Figma file yet). Remaining items wait for Figma / calendar.

- [x] References in `design/references/` with notes on what we take from each (no Figma link yet)
- [x] Tokens → `design/tokens.json` → CSS variables / Tailwind theme, light + dark, contrast checked (≥ 4.5:1)
- [x] Core components: buttons, inputs, selects, cards, status pills, stat cards, dialogs, sheets (details panel), tabs, toasts, empty states, avatar with staff colour, colour swatches
- [x] App shell: grouped sidebar (desktop), bottom navigation + "More" page (mobile), dark-mode switch
- [x] Phase 0 + 1 screens in the new style; checked at 375px and 1280–1440px
- [ ] Final fonts and visual check against a Figma file (when available)
- [ ] Date/time picker components (with the calendar, Phase 3)

## Phase 3 — Calendar and bookings (≈ 2 weeks) — SPEC 4.5–4.7
Split into 3a and 3b with a report in between (Levan, 2026-10-26). Staff may create and move only their own bookings; admin bookings start as confirmed.

### 3a ✅ Done 2026-10-27
- [x] Availability engine (booking-engine skill) with unit tests (17; #14 concurrency runs against the database)
- [x] Exclusion constraints against double booking (staff + resource), concurrency test
- [x] Calendar: day (by staff), week (one person), list (phone default), month counts — own grid, decision 005

- [x] Statuses + status history (incl. undo of cancel/no-show, no-show counter)
- [x] Realtime updates between admins
- [x] Staff view "My day": now / next / today / upcoming / past, actions, own numbers

- [x] Day view by chair/room for dental — done in 3b

### 3b ✅ Done 2026-10-26
- [x] Recurring bookings (every N weeks, X times, conflict list before saving; cancel this and all following)
- [x] Waitlist with suggestions when a slot frees up
- [x] Import existing bookings from CSV/Excel (column mapping, preview, conflict report, no SMS ever) — not yet tried on a real export from a salon's old system
- [x] Checkout: payment methods, split payment, discounts, tip, daily cash summary; owner decides whether admins see revenue
- [x] Dental: day view by chair/room
- [x] Speed: day view with 15 staff × 150 bookings loads in ~340 ms (test `perf_calendar`)
- [x] Panels load in parallel (GET /api/read, decision 006) — buttons no longer wait behind loading panels

- [x] Real availability, "any staff" option — same engine as the admin calendar, online rules

- [x] SMS OTP — on by default, owner can switch off; fake SMS provider until Phase 5 plugs in a real one
- [x] Manage-booking link `/m/[key]` (move / cancel within the cancellation window, then the business phone)
- [x] .ics "add to calendar", QR code, link sharing (settings card)
- [x] Rate limiting (per phone, per IP behind the host) and honeypot — Cloudflare Turnstile before launch (Levan, 2026-10-26)
- [ ] Later: business photo gallery (Phase 6 polish, Levan 2026-10-26)

## Phase 5 — SMS (≈ 1 week) — SPEC 4.9 ✅ Done 2026-10-26 (without a real SMS company — Levan chooses later)

- [x] Templates (ka/en/ru) with variables, character & segment counter, live preview
- [x] Sender name settings and status (approval set by the server only)
- [x] Scheduled reminders job (idempotent), quiet hours — 2 h on by default, 24 h optional (Levan, 2026-10-26)
- [x] Message log with filters — [ ] delivery reports from the real provider (webhook → `sms_delivery`)
- [x] SMS credits ledger in SMS parts, 50 trial SMS (Levan, 2026-10-26), low-balance warning — [ ] top-up screen for the platform admin (Phase 6)
